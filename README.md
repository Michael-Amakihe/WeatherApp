Hey Mike,

I'd say the first thing you want to do is seperate your files out as everything is in a single .js file. At a minimum you should have a a mark-up file (html), a stylesheet (css) and then a functional file (js). 
I believe chat gpt suggested a good layout so I would follow that guidance, I'd also try to use chat gpt sparringly as over using it will prevent you from fully understanding what you're doing. Annoyingly I think most
people learn better from making mistakes and then figuring out how to fix them.

I wasn't able to run your app in it's current state but i imagine it works just fine when it's all in the right files etc. If you sort out the files I can check it out again though
